          My name is Sam Hazinski and I'm an aspiring web developer. I recently finished the UNCC fullstack webdev bootcamp where I learned the MERN stack. Prior to learning MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, I learned other technologies/languages such as HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Postgres, MySQL, Javascript, and API usage.
